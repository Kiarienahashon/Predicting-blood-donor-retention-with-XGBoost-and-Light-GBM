The Hybrid Ensemble Gradient Boosting Model for Blood Donor Retention was developed to enhance the prediction of potential repeat blood donors. The study aimed to build a high-performing machine learning model by combining the strengths of XGBoost and LightGBM, two of the most effective gradient boosting algorithms. XGBoost was selected for its ability to control overfitting, while LightGBM was chosen for its efficiency in handling large datasets. By integrating these models into an ensemble, the study sought to improve prediction accuracy and ensure better generalization.

The project focused on optimizing the ensemble model using Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, a technique that systematically selects the best model parameters to improve performance. The evaluation of the model was conducted using various performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. The dataset, obtained from Kenyan blood banks, consisted of 5000 records and nine key features, including donor demographics and donation history.

The results of the study were highly promising, with the hybrid ensemble model achieving an accuracy of 99.00% and an F1-score of 99.00%, demonstrating superior performance in predicting blood donor retention. A 5-fold cross-validation process confirmed the modelâ€™s consistency and reliability. Furthermore, feature importance analysis revealed that factors such as the number of previous donations and the months since the last donation played a crucial role in determining donor retention.

These findings offer valuable insights for blood banks and healthcare institutions, enabling them to develop targeted retention strategies to maintain a stable and sufficient blood supply. The application of AI-driven predictive analytics in blood donor retention can significantly reduce recruitment efforts, save time and resources, and ultimately enhance the efficiency of blood donation programs. This study highlights the potential of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges in healthcare and public health management.
